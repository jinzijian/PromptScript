        "prompts":"Please analyze how to complete the following task: Sitting in front of the mirror. The following constraints exist: Lack of knowledge on correct sitting posture, such as not knowing how to sit properly on a chair to maintain a good posture. There are not enough large or appropriate mirrors to reflect one's whole body. The environment is too dark to see the reflection in the mirror clearly. Time constraint: Need to complete the task of sitting down and self-observing in front of the mirror within 5 minutes. Please consider the following analysis methods: \n1. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Compare the total cost of completing the task (including time, resources, opportunity cost) with the expected benefits. Calculate the Return on Investment (ROI). \n2. Feasibility Analysis: Assess technical feasibility (availability of necessary technology and tools), economic feasibility (sufficient budget), legal feasibility (compliance with relevant regulations), operational feasibility (adequate manpower and process support). \n3. Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks, evaluate the probability and impact of each risk, calculate risk value (probability x impact), propose risk mitigation strategies. \n4. Resource Allocation Analysis: List required resources (manpower, equipment, funds, etc.), evaluate existing resources, develop resource acquisition plans, create resource allocation schedules. \n5. Time Management Analysis: Break down the task into specific steps, estimate time needed for each step, create a Gantt chart or critical path diagram, identify time bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. \nPlease select the most appropriate analysis method for evaluating this task and briefly explain your choice. \nThen, follow the specific steps of the chosen method to analyze and assess whether the task can be completed within the given constraints. \nIf the assessment shows that the task can be completed, please start with the number 0, provide the chosen analysis method and a brief completion plan based on the analysis. \nIf the assessment shows that the task cannot be completed, please start with the number 1, provide the chosen analysis method and the specific reasons for inability to complete based on the analysis. \nPlease output the answer in the following JSON format: \n{0, \"analysis_method\": \"<chosen method>\", \"completion_plan\": \"<brief completion plan based on analysis>\"} or {1, \"analysis_method\": \"<chosen method>\", \"reason\": \"<specific reasons for inability to complete based on analysis>\"} Stick to the format. Do not output any other things!",

The technical feasibility is compromised due to the lack of appropriate mirrors and poor lighting conditions. The operational feasibility is also compromised as the individual lacks knowledge on correct sitting posture, which is essential for completing the task effectively within the time constraint.\"}\n```",
