If you don't have enough cash, try asking a friend or family member to lend you some money. If you don't have a payment tool, try using a debit or credit card if possible. If you don't have access to a card, try borrowing one from someone you know. If you're unable to complete the task within 30 minutes, try to buy ice cream at a later time when you have more time and resources available.\"}\n\n\ubc88\uc5ed\uacb0\uacfc  \n{0, \"\uc194\ub8e8\uc158: \ube59\uc218\ub97c \ud310\ub9e4\ud558\ub294 \uadfc\ucc98 \ud3b8\uc758\uc810\uc774\ub098 \uc8fc\uc720\uc18c\ub85c \uac78\uc5b4\uac00\uc11c \ud604\uae08\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624. \ud604\uae08\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba74 \uce5c\uad6c\ub098 \uac00\uc871\uc5d0\uac8c \ube4c\ub824 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc694. \uc9c0\ubd88 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub370\ube57 \ub610\ub294 \ud06c\ub808\ub527 \uce74\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624. \uce74\ub4dc\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc5d0\uac8c \ube4c\ub824 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc694. 30\ubd84 \uc774\ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \ub098\uc911\uc5d0 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c \ube59\uc218\ub97c \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624.\"}",
