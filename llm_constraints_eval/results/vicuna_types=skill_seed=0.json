Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Set a consistent bedtime: Go to bed at the same time every night to establish a regular sleep schedule. Aim to wake up around 6 AM, which will give you enough time to get ready for work before 7 AM.\n2. Create a relaxing bedtime routine: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine to signal your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretching.\n3. Use natural light: Open your curtains or blinds in the morning to let natural sunlight into your room. The sunlight will help regulate your body's internal clock and signal your brain to wake up.\n4. Avoid electronic devices before bedtime: The blue light emitted by smartphones, tablets, and laptops can interfere with your sleep. Try to avoid using these devices for at least an hour before bedtime.\n5. Consider investing in a \"sunrise alarm clock\": Although you said you don't know how to use an alarm clock, a sunrise alarm clock is a different type of device that simulates a sunrise to help you wake up gently. It can be a helpful alternative to a traditional alarm clock.\n\nBy following these steps and creating a consistent routine, you should be able to wake up before 7 AM on workdays without relying on an alarm clock."

If the vehicle is parked, the individual can exit the vehicle as soon as it comes to a complete stop. If the vehicle is in motion, the individual should wait for it to come to a complete stop before attempting to exit. It is important to use the appropriate exit method, such as opening the door and stepping out of the vehicle.\n\nSince the individual cannot drive themselves to their destination, they will need to rely on another means of transportation to get to the vehicle. Once they arrive at the vehicle, they can wait for it to come to a complete stop and then quickly exit within 30 seconds.\n\nOverall, this solution allows the individual to complete the task of getting out of the car within the time limit while also adhering to the constraint of not being able to drive themselves to their destination."
